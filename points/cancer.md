# Q: Can 5G cause cancer?
## A: No. The power of 5G transmitters is nowhere near strong enough to do any harm.
5G transmitters transmit microwaves. There is no evidence of these causing any type of cancer, the worst they can do is burn you (which is impossible with 5G as the power transmitted is so weak). Cancer can only be caused by much worse radiation like UV, X-Rays and Gamma Rays.
