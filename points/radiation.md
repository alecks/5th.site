# Q: Can 5G's radiation harm me?
## A: Nope. Definitely not.

The frequency at which 5G in the UK sits is generally 3.4GHz-3.6GHz. This is a tiny difference in comparison to 4G's frequency; it sits at a maximum of 2.6GHz. Visible light literally comes in at a frequency more than 100,000 times higher than that of 5G, and 1,000 times more than the microwave with the highest frequency.

There's no proof showing that the radiation coming off of 5G is harmful. It's non-ionising.
