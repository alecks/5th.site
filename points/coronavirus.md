# Q: Did 5G cause COVID-19?
## A: No. Of course not.

First of all, the novel coronavirus is, well, a virus. It's scientifically proven and there's hardly any argument about it. Second, there's absolutely no way that 5G could've caused it in the first place. Its waves are non-ionising; they quite frankly don't have the power to do anything to your body. Well, that's if you don't include this page being served over 5G. Surely making you smarter is doing something to you?
