# Q: Should we burn 5G masts?
## A: How is this even a question? Of course you shouldn't.

Burning 5G masts increases the chance of your body being messed with by 100%. Think about it: why would you go near and **burn** something that you think is going to harm you? It's simply illogical; the fumes given off from a burning mast are much more dangerous than those from masts that aren't burning. Let's not forget that it's likely you'll be charged with arson.
