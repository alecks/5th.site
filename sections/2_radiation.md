# Q: Can 5G's radiation harm me?
## A: No! Mid/low-band 5G is much the same as 4G, 3G and other standards before.


All types of electromagnetic radiation fall on the Electromagnetic Spectrum. When looking at it, one may be shocked to see that 5G and other communications fall scarily close to the frequency of microwaves. However, the radiation spectrum is logarithmic and mmwave 5G falls at around 100GHz compared to an an average microwave at 300GHz. Mid-band 5G (sub-6GHz) is even safer and is comparable to mid-band 4G at 2.5-3.5GHz.

This, however, is not as concerning as it may seem. 5G transmitters have a power of AT MOST 40 watts; this is much less than the power you may find in your home microwave, which ranges from cheap 700 watt microwaves up to 1200 watt range units. If 40 watts still seems a lot to you, by the time the radiation reaches your body, this will be 0.001 watts or less thanks to the inverse square law.
