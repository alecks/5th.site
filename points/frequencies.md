# Q: Are 5G frequencies harmful?
## A: No! It's much the same as 4G, 3G and other standards before, nothing harmful.

All types of electromagnetic radiation fall on the Electromagnetic Spectrum. When looking at it, one may be shocked to see that 5G and other communications fall scarily close to the frequency of microwaves.

This, however, is not as concerning as it may seem. 5G transmitters have a power of AT MOST 40 Watts, this is much less than the power you may find in your home microwave, which is up to 800 Watts in some models. If 40 Watts still seems a lot to you, by the time the radiation reaches your body, this will be 0.001 of a Watt or less meaning no harm to you is done.
