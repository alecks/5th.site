# Q: Can 5G cause cancer?
## A: No. The power of 5G transmitters is nowhere near strong enough to do any harm.

Rare millimeter wave 5G transmitters transmit microwaves, and the most common mid-band and low-band transmit waves with frequencies very similar to 4G. There is no evidence of these causing any type of cancer, the worst they can do is burn you (which is impossible with 5G as the power transmitted is so weak). The sun is giving you far more deadly radiation than any 5G mmwave node. Cancer can only be caused by much worse ionizing radiation like UV, X-Rays and Gamma Rays.
