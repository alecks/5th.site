# Q: 5G is non-ionising, is this dangerous?
## A: Nope! All this distinguishes is the way the way the waves react with the objects around us.
Unlike X-Rays and ionising radiation which can modify the structure of things, all non-ionising radiation can do is heat objects, like a microwave. There is no risk of this happening with 5G as the waves are too weak so don't worry about getting fried!
